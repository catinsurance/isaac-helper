# isaac-helper
A modular, expanded TBoI: Repentance helper library where you only need to download the submodules you need.

Most submodules have documentation. In general I only add new submodules when I have freetime, but you're welcome to make a pull request if you want to add a new submodule.

# How to install, documentation, examples, and general information
[You can find out how to install, how to use, get documentation, learn the purposes of all submodules, and more by checking out the gitbook website!](https://maya-bee.gitbook.io/api-docs/)
